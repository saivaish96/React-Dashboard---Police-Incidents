# React-Dashboard---Police-Incidents
This application was created as part of a take home assignment for the Virginia Beach Technology Department.
Step 1: I chose the data called Police Incident Reports from https://data.virginiabeach.gov/datasets/67bc708103e746f18e216c32ba39febe_0/about.
Step 2: I was asked to take a subset of data from this collection and create a MVP with one simple feature. So, I chose to create a dashboard that shows statistics, graphs from the records of data. 
Step 3: I chose the Chakra UI design system to accomplish this application suing React. 
Step 4: So, the MVP has two tabs: (1) Dashboard that visualizes different subsets of the given data
                                  (2) Data Table that lists the incident report in a table format with pagiantion.
                                  
Please find screenshots and recording of the app below. 
To run the app, clone the repository and run the following commands: npm install and npm start inside the working directory.
